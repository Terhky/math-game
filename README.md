# math-game

  A game that contains a time limit and within that time asks the player various basic arithmetic questions.
The player must asnwer these as many of these as fast as possible. At the end of the game the user will be given a
score and a correct percentage which shows the averege percentege of correct questions.

  If the user decides to play again, this score will be overwritten and if not then the user is given a choice to save
the score with his/her name and score in a .txt file on the user's computer to store all time highscores. If the user
beats their score then the program looks for the user's inputted name to see if its int eh list and if it is then
it will rewrite the user's last score and arrange the table to show the top scoring percentages as the top players.

I tried to do this game using the least modules as possible in order to challenge myself.
